Non tradional variation on the previous flappy bird game. 
==========
Modified by Wade Helquist.
==========
Variable openings for pipes. 
Added score is dependent on how large/small the opening is.
Smaller openings give more points.
In-between each pipe opening it shows how much points you will get for that pipe.

Alternates between night and day with every round and every 250 points earned.
Night and day have color changes to bird, pipes, and background.
